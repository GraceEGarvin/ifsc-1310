    <h2>Dragon Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>While working to revise the SpaceX Dragon project, I asked a few family members to look over the original project. I also showed them the changes I was making and asked them to comment on that as well. They all agreed with the changes I was making, preferring them over the original. One of them thought the articles were too small, so I adjusted them to be easier to see not only the text, but the photos as well. </p>
    <p>Going back through the project, I was able to make a number of small and a few bigger changes, some of them I actually wanted to do much earlier but did not include them in the first attempt. An example of this is the FAQ. I wanted the ability for users to open and close information on the FAQ, as to not fill the page with too much info the user may not be looking for. I made some still images transition with javascript, which I liked better since the single image in the home and history pages on its own felt slightly out of place. </p>
    <p>With the feedback I was given, I set out to make changes to set it apart, mostly with the changes I had planned already. I ran into a challenge rather quickly as I revised the website: some of the ideas I had did not go well with the rest of the website. I experimented a lot with css, but with some ideas I was never satisfied, and it seemed to off-putting compared to what I had originally. For example, the header never saw a significant change. I played around with the layout, but the backgrounds or layouts I tried did not mesh well with the rest of the website. </p>
    <p>With this project, I both loved and hated the css process. It was fun to see everything come together, but it was quite the challenge to work with when even a single detail was missing, and I found myself messing around with css trying to find out what I did wrong for hours. I felt I did well with keeping the website itself organized, but I did not feel organized in the coding aspect. If i could go back and change things, one of them would have been just to go back and do it with a more organized setup and better workflow. I feel like this would have made the project look less like the demo and more of its own. I also wish I did not start the project out with it looking like the demo. I feel like that really took a toll on the revision process. </p>
    <p>As far as the course as a whole, I enjoyed this semester. I have learned a lot this year, and I feel that this will be a great start for the future. I do wish I saw more of javascript, as I would have liked to know more about it, but I am glad to have gotten what I need as far as basics for HTML and CSS. There are a lot of areas where I feel I could have done a lot better, but I will take those projects and areas as learning experiences for the future. </p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a method of starting simple and progressively adding complexity. It is a better way to go about creating websites than concepts like graceful degradation since progressive enhancement covers more bases in the event of various issues, especially issues that are based on browsers or devices. The focus becomes less on the complexity and more on the content and how the content will be presented to different users. </p>
